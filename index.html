		I was able to speak briefly with well-known builder JamalMC about traditional arts and its contributions to his own building style. This conversation was had during his Twitch stream on October 29th, 2025, at roughly 8 hours into the stream.  While Jamal doesn’t sketch, he does use 3D mock-ups within Minecraft itself. By using tools like WorldEdit, it allows him to start with a shape and carve into it to create the sculpture he may be trying to create. In particular, he spoke about the build of a pegasus he has in his hardcore world. He spoke extensively about how he used sculpting techniques to create the statue in his base. 
        <br> <br>
Twitch user miss_illusive_nix said during a stream, “Art and Minecraft go hand in hand.”
<br><br>
Jamal then gave this incredible response. “Oh 100%! Like people ask me how I do these builds. Like a lot of it goes back to traditional art”
<br> <br>
Jamal, during this conversation, also showed his wire framing underneath his mountain. Using dirt blocks, he was able to lay out the entire mountain. This wireframe helped him with where to place each individual block, and it is still preserved underneath the stone above; he could still go underneath and see every step of his process. It is very similar to how we, as artists, would capture the process with photos, but Jamal has the privilege of simply looking underneath his build.
